# PintereStorm
Hi there !
The project goal was to create a tool, which eventually will aid designers during their brainstorming process. By choosing two distinct objects (represented as nodes on a weighted graph), characterized by different categories, users can find the shortest path between the two, gradually through other objects sharing similarities. The shortest Pathfinding process was implemented in two different ways - using Dijkstra and A-star algorithms. Finally, for each node in the shortest path, the top results images, matching its characteristics on ‘Pinterest’ will be displayed – building a visual map for the user.
